Solution:

To back up your static website using GitHub, you can follow these steps. This guide assumes you have Git installed on your computer, and you're familiar with using the terminal/command prompt.

Step-by-Step Guide for Backing Up Your Static Website Using GitHub

1. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and log in or create an account if you don’t have one.

Click the + icon in the top right and select New repository.

Name your repository (e.g., my-static-website), choose to make it Public or Private, and click Create repository.

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with instructions on how to add your project.


2. Install Git (if you haven't already)

If you don't have Git installed, you can download it from here.

After installation, verify by running the following in your terminal/command prompt:


git --version

    Now to check the current configured user information inside the local github setup then hit following commands:

        git config --global user.name
        git config --global user.email

3. Initialize Your Local Project Directory

Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to your website’s folder. For example:

cd path/to/your/project-folder

Then, initialize the directory as a Git repository by hitting followign command in terminal:

git init

4. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
After initializing Git, you need to link your local project to the GitHub repository you created.
 Get the repository's URL from GitHub (it will look like https://github.com/username/my-static-website.git).

In your terminal, run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-static-website.git

5. Add Your Project Files

git add .

This stages all the changes in your project.

6. Commit Your Changes
After staging the files, commit the changes to Git by hitiing followign commanad:

git commit -m "Initial commit of my static website"

7. Push Your Files to GitHub

Push the files from your local repository to the remote GitHub repository by hitting followign command:

git push -u origin master

If you're working with the main branch instead of master, replace master with main by hitting following commnad:

git push -u origin main

Git may prompt you to enter your GitHub credentials the first time.

8. Verify Your Backup

Go back to your GitHub repository page and refresh the page.

You should now see all your website files uploaded and backed up on GitHub.
