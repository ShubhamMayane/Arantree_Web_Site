name
email
mobile number 

so tell me the javascript code which validate above form and send the all above form information to the specific mail id  in specific template 
ChatGPT said:
To create a solution where a form collects name, email, and mobile number, validates the inputs, and then sends the information to a specific email address in a specific template, we can break the task down into two main parts:



Solution:

Client-side validation using JavaScript.
Sending the form data to an email. Since JavaScript alone can't send emails (due to security reasons), we will need a backend service or an email API like EmailJS or SMTP for this functionality.
Step 1: HTML Form
Here's the basic structure of your HTML form:

html
Copy
<form id="contactForm">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <label for="mobile">Mobile Number:</label>
  <input type="text" id="mobile" name="mobile" required>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Step 2: JavaScript for Form Validation
We will use JavaScript to validate the form before sending the data. This includes checking if all fields are filled and if the email is in the correct format.

javascript
Copy
document.getElementById("contactForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();  // Prevent form from submitting normally
    
    const name = document.getElementById("name").value;
    const email = document.getElementById("email").value;
    const mobile = document.getElementById("mobile").value;

    // Basic validation
    if (!name || !email || !mobile) {
        alert("All fields are required!");
        return;
    }

    // Email validation
    const emailPattern = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
    if (!emailPattern.test(email)) {
        alert("Please enter a valid email address.");
        return;
    }

    // Mobile number validation (simple check for 10 digits)
    const mobilePattern = /^[0-9]{10}$/;
    if (!mobilePattern.test(mobile)) {
        alert("Please enter a valid mobile number (10 digits).");
        return;
    }

    // If validation passes, send the form data to the email (via API or backend)
    sendEmail(name, email, mobile);
});

function sendEmail(name, email, mobile) {
    // Here you would use an API like EmailJS, or send data to your backend to send an email.

    // Example using EmailJS:
    emailjs.send("your_service_id", "your_template_id", {
        name: name,
        email: email,
        mobile: mobile
    })
    .then(function(response) {
        alert("Your message has been sent successfully!");
    }, function(error) {
        alert("There was an error sending the message. Please try again.");
    });
}
Step 3: Using EmailJS to Send the Email
To actually send the email, we can use an email service like EmailJS, which allows sending emails directly from the frontend without requiring a backend server.

Sign Up for EmailJS: Go to EmailJS and create an account.
Create a Service: After signing up, create a new email service (e.g., Gmail, SMTP).
Create an Email Template: Define the template in EmailJS to format the email as you want (e.g., including name, email, and mobile).
Get Your Service ID, Template ID, and User ID: These will be provided in the EmailJS dashboard.
Now, update the JavaScript function sendEmail() with the correct service_id, template_id, and user_id.

javascript
Copy
function sendEmail(name, email, mobile) {
    emailjs.send("your_service_id", "your_template_id", {
        name: name,
        email: email,
        mobile: mobile
    }, "your_user_id")
    .then(function(response) {
        alert("Your message has been sent successfully!");
    }, function(error) {
        alert("There was an error sending the message. Please try again.");
    });
}
Email Template Example
You can define your template in EmailJS with placeholders like:

html
Copy
<p>Name: {{name}}</p>
<p>Email: {{email}}</p>
<p>Mobile: {{mobile}}</p>
Important Notes:
EmailJS is a third-party service that allows sending emails directly from the frontend, so you don't need a backend server.
If you donâ€™t want to use a service like EmailJS, you will need to set up a backend server with a proper mail-sending mechanism (e.g., using Node.js with Nodemailer or PHP with SMTP) to securely send emails.
Ensure the email data is properly sanitized to avoid security issues like spam and malicious injections.
